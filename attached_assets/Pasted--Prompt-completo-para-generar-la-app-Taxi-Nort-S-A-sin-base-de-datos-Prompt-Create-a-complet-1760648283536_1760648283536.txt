🚖 Prompt completo para generar la app Taxi Nort S.A. (sin base de datos)

Prompt:

Create a complete full-stack fleet management web application for a public transport company named Taxi Nort S.A., focused on route slips (“hojas de ruta”), driver and vehicle management, payment tracking, and GPS simulation.

🧩 General requirements:

The app must run entirely locally — no external database, only local JSON files or in-memory storage.

Include both frontend (React + TailwindCSS) and backend (Node.js + Express) in the same project.

Structure the folders as:

/server  → Node.js backend
/client  → React frontend
/data    → JSON storage files

👥 Authentication system:

Register and login users with JWT authentication and bcrypt password hashing.

Store tokens in localStorage on the client.

Support four roles:

admin – full access

operator – can manage drivers and vehicles

finance – manages payments

driver – can view assigned routes

Include registration page (sign up) and login page.

Seed one default admin user:

Email: admin@taxinort.local

Password: Admin123!

🚗 Driver and Vehicle management:

CRUD for drivers: name, RUT, phone, license number, status.

CRUD for vehicles: plate, model, color, owner name, technical review date.

Drivers can be assigned to vehicles.

🧾 Route slips (“Hojas de ruta”):

Allow creation of daily route slips with:

Date, vehicle, driver, signature/stamp, payment status, and notes.

Detect automatically if a route slip is duplicate (same driver, vehicle, and date).

Validate missing route slips automatically.

Save all route slips to /data/slips.json.

💰 Payment system:

Record daily payments (CLP $1,800) and monthly payments (CLP $43,200).

Upload proof of payment (image or PDF) and store it locally in /uploads.

Show payment history by driver or vehicle.

Track pending and completed payments.

📡 Real-time GPS simulation:

Use Socket.io to simulate real-time GPS coordinates for vehicles.

Each vehicle emits random coordinates every few seconds.

Display all vehicles on a live map in the dashboard (use Leaflet or Google Maps).

📊 Dashboard and reports:

Interactive dashboard showing:

Total vehicles

Active drivers

Pending payments

Compliance percentage

Include real-time map of vehicle locations.

🧾 Audit log:

Track every action (create, update, delete) across users, vehicles, and payments.

Save logs in /data/audit.json with timestamp, user, action, and entity affected.

🖥️ Frontend (React + TailwindCSS):

Pages required:

Login / Register

Dashboard (with map and KPIs)

Drivers management

Vehicles management

Route slips management

Payments

Audit log view

Include navigation bar and sidebar.

Make the design responsive and clean.

⚙️ Backend (Node.js + Express):

REST API endpoints for:

/api/auth (register, login, verify token)

/api/drivers

/api/vehicles

/api/slips

/api/payments

/api/audit

/api/gps (Socket.io endpoint for live updates)

Use local JSON files inside /data for all CRUD operations.

Store uploads in /uploads.

🚀 Run instructions:

Provide a README.md with these steps:

# Run backend
cd server
npm install
npm start

# Run frontend
cd ../client
npm install
npm start


The app must work entirely offline, store all data locally, and simulate all GPS and backend operations.
